Pool supports up to 5000 cards and more.<br>
Each card executes its own chunk (a small segment from a given range)<br>
Automatic download and update of addresses from the server.<br>
The client can search for 4 types of BTC addresses (1 uncopressed, 1 compressed, 3, bc) at once or ETH.<br>
The address database is hashed, if it is changed by the client, it is downloaded again.<br>

When the client is first launched, it downloads the address database, then it takes 15 minutes to create the acceleration table ecmult_big-536870912-24.bin (5.7 GB)<br>
You can copy the table to another rig if it has a weak processor so you don't have to wait.<br>
When launched again, the client reads the table, starts immediately.

Support only CUDA cards (CMP cards work)<br>
Os: windows, ubuntu, lin, hive.

Only the speed is displayed in the client window.<br>
If it finds the found address, it is displayed<br>
